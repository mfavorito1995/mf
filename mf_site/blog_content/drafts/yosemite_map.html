    <h2>
        Yosemite National Park is a real place with surreal scenery.

        My first trip to Yosemite was in 2018 with my father.
        It would be a trip of firsts for us both.
        For my father, it would be his first trip to a National Park and his first time camping (not a bad place to be your first in either regard).
        And for me, it would be my first time in California - the state I now call home - and my first time sharing my love for camping and our National Parks with my family.

        It was an amazing trip. Travelling the week leading up to <strong>CHECK DATES</strong> Labor Day, we were lucky to get a campground at Crane Flat, a peaceful campground about 30/45 minutes outside of Yosemite Valley.
        Spending 3 nights beneath the pines, we explored as much as we could in Yosemite Valley. Our crowning achievement, and one of my most treasured memories, was climbing the many, many, many switchbacks of the Yosemite Falls Trail. While that trail has views that are always rewarding, we were blessed on that first ascent with a swim at the top of the falls.
        Returning in May 2023 with a larger group, it was an entirely different hike - still steep, yes, but in early summer the falls were torrential. Instead of a dip at the top, we were misted throughout the journey. Arriving at the top hopeful for a repeat swim, I found spot where my father and I sat in September 2018, was under at least 20 feet of rushing water.

        I made this map after my frist trip. Blown away and inspired, I wanted to learn more about what lay beyond the valley. I knew there was more, but as I added struggled to capture the details of Yostemite Valley against the scale of the entire park, it really set in.
        Since making this map, I have returned twice and each time I slowly chip away at other sections of the map, filling in memories where topographic lines lay.

        The most recent time I was there, August 2023 with my parents and partner Cam, we explored more of the park outside of the valley:
        First, to the south, in the Mariposa Grove, we walked among massive seqoias.
        Then, heading up and over to Lake Tahoe on Tioga Road, we swam in montain lakes and saw deer run across alpine meadows.
